# BenchRestTest
Code for the Programming Challenge provided on June 25, 2021

This code can be run from the command line using
`python resttest_usingDataFrame.py`
and requires the following modules:
* requests
* json
* numpy
* pandas. 


These modules need to be downloaded (using pip or other package managers) and the python path and system path variables needs to point to the directories containing the modules.
