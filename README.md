# BenchRestTest
Code for the Programming Challenge provided on June 25, 2021

This code can be run from the command line using
`python resttest_usingDataFrame.py`
and requires the following modules:
* requests
* json
* numpy
* pandas. 


These modules need to be downloaded (using pip or other package managers) and the python path and system path variables needs to point to the directories containing the modules. 

There are two versions of the code, one using a Data Frame (allows accessing variables by name, which would likely be my preferred method) and using a List (uses hard-coded indices, less elegant).
